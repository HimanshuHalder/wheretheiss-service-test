Feature: This feature is to identify location of ISS using api services

  Scenario Outline: User calls the API with valid details to get satellite location "<description>"
    Given User is having a satellite NORMAD id as "<satelliteId>"
    When the user will call the "<endpoint>" with "<timestamp>", "<units>" and "<indents>"
    Then the status code is 200
    And receive a valid response

    @valid @test
    Examples:
      | description                                               | satelliteId | endpoint                 | timestamp                                 | units      | indents |

  Scenario Outline: User calls the API with invalid details to get satellite location "<description>"
    Given User is having a satellite NORMAD id as "<satelliteId>"
    When the user will call the "<endpoint>" with "<timestamp>", "<units>" and "<indents>"
    Then should return status code as "<errorCode>"
    And user should receive an error message as like "<errorMessage>"
